## Reasoning

1. We need to address the issue of session replication in the provided `web.xml` file.
2. Based on the recommendations, we have three options:
   - Review the session replication usage and ensure that it is configured properly.
   - Disable HTTP session clustering and accept its implications.
   - Re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.
3. Since the file provided is `web.xml` which is specific to Java EE, we cannot review the session replication usage or disable HTTP session clustering in this file. These changes would need to be made in the application code or configuration files specific to the Java EE server being used.
4. To re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data grid, we would need to make changes in the application code and possibly in external dependencies.
5. As we are migrating to Quarkus, we will replace the `web.xml` file with a `application.properties` file and configure the session management accordingly.
6. We will use Infinispan as the remote data grid for session management.
7. To use Infinispan in Quarkus, we need to add the following dependency in the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-infinispan-client</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

8. We also need to configure the `application.properties` file to use Infinispan as the remote data grid for session management.

```properties
quarkus.http.session-store=infinispan
quarkus.infinispan.server-list=<Infinispan server URL>
```

9. With these changes, we have addressed the issue of session replication and re-architected the application to use a remote data grid for session management.

## Updated File

```properties
quarkus.http.session-store=infinispan
quarkus.infinispan.server-list=<Infinispan server URL>
```

## Additional Information

- Make sure to replace `<Infinispan server URL>` with the actual URL of the Infinispan server.
- The changes made in this step are specific to Quarkus and do not affect the Java EE code. The Java EE code will need to be updated in subsequent steps to remove any dependencies on session replication.
