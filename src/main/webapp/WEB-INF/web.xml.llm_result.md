## Reasoning

Quarkus is a Kubernetes native Java framework for writing microservices and serverless applications. It is designed to be fast and reactive, and it supports both reactive and imperative styles of programming. It is built on a stack of libraries that includes libraries such as Mutiny, RESTEasy, and Hibernate ORM.

The `web.xml` file is a deployment descriptor file used in Java EE web applications. It is used to configure the web application and its components, such as servlets, filters, and listeners.

In Quarkus, the `web.xml` file is not used. Instead, Quarkus uses annotation-based configuration and a configuration file called `application.properties` to configure the application.

Therefore, in order to take a step towards migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus, we need to remove the `web.xml` file and configure the application using annotation-based configuration and the `application.properties` file.

## Updated File

Since the `web.xml` file is not used in Quarkus, there is no need to include it in the project. Therefore, the updated file is empty.

## Additional Information

* To configure the application in Quarkus, you can use annotation-based configuration or the `application.properties` file. For example, to configure a REST endpoint, you can use the `@Path` annotation in the endpoint class.
* To configure the application using the `application.properties` file, you can add properties to the file and reference them in the code using the `@ConfigProperty` annotation.
* If the `web.xml` file contains any configuration that is not supported in Quarkus, you will need to find an alternative way to configure that feature in Quarkus. For example, if the `web.xml` file contains a servlet mapping, you can use the `@ApplicationScoped` and `@Path` annotations to create a REST endpoint in Quarkus.
* If the `web.xml` file contains any security configuration, you will need to find an alternative way to configure security in Quarkus. Quarkus provides a security module that can be used to secure endpoints and authenticate users.
* If the `web.xml` file contains any configuration for third-party libraries, you will need to find an alternative way to configure those libraries in Quarkus. Quarkus provides a number of extensions that can be used to integrate third-party libraries into the application.

Here is an example of how to create a REST endpoint in Quarkus:

```java
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello from Quarkus!";
    }
}
```

And here is an example of how to configure the application using the `application.properties` file:

```
quarkus.http.cors=true
quarkus.http.cors.origins=*
```

These properties can be referenced in the code using the `@ConfigProperty` annotation:

```java
import javax.inject.Inject;
import javax.ws.rs.GET;
import javax.ws.rs.Path;
import javax.ws.rs.Produces;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.config.inject.ConfigProperty;

@Path("/hello")
public class HelloResource {

    @Inject
    @ConfigProperty(name = "quarkus.http.cors")
    private boolean corsEnabled;

    @GET
    @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
    public String hello() {
        if (corsEnabled) {
            // Perform CORS check
        }
        return "Hello from Quarkus!";
    }
}
```

Therefore, to take a step towards migrating the JavaEE code to Quarkus, we need to remove the `web.xml` file and configure the application using annotations and the `application.properties` file.

## Updated File

Since the `web.xml` file is not used in Quarkus, we can simply remove it. Therefore, the updated file is empty.

```xml
<!-- Empty file -->
```

## Additional Information

After removing the `web.xml` file, you will need to configure the application using annotations and the `application.properties` file. You may also need to update the dependencies in the `pom.xml` file to use Quarkus-compatible versions of the libraries used in the JavaEE application.

For example, if the JavaEE application uses the `javax.servlet-api` library, you will need to replace it with the `jakarta.servlet-api` library, which is used in Quarkus. You may also need to update other dependencies to use Quarkus-compatible versions.

Here is an example of how to update the `pom.xml` file to use the `jakarta.servlet-api` library:

Before:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>javax.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>javax.servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>3.1.0</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

After:
```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.servlet</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta.servlet-api</artifactId>
  <version>5.0.0</version>
  <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

Note that the groupId has been changed from `javax.servlet` to `jakarta.servlet`, and the version number has been updated to 5.0.0.

You may also need to update the imports in the Java code to use the `jakarta` package instead of the `javax` package. For example, the `javax.servlet.ServletException` class should be replaced with the `jakarta.servlet.ServletException` class.

Here is an example of how to update the imports in a Java file:

Before:
```java
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
```

After:
```java
import jakarta.servlet.ServletException;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.HttpConstraint;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.ServletSecurity;
import jakarta.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
```

Note that the `javax` package has been replaced with the `jakarta` package.
