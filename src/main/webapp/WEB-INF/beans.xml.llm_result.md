## Reasoning

1. The first step is to understand the issues that need to be addressed. In this case, there are five issues related to the namespace and schema location in the `beans.xml` file.

2. The first three issues are related to the namespace in lines 18, 19, and 20. The current namespace is `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee`, but it needs to be updated to `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. This change is necessary because Java EE has been rebranded to Jakarta EE, and the namespace has been updated to reflect this change.

3. The fourth issue is related to the schema location in line 21. The current schema location is `beans_1_1.xsd`, but it needs to be updated to `beans_3_0.xsd` and the version attribute needs to be updated to `"3.0"`. This change is necessary because the schema version has been updated to reflect the changes in Jakarta EE 9.

4. The fifth issue is related to the `beans.xml` descriptor content. The content of this file is ignored in Quarkus, and it could be removed from the application. However, it is recommended to keep it for compatibility reasons.

5. Based on the reasoning, the updated `beans.xml` file will look like this:

## Additional Information

It is important to note that the `beans.xml` file is not required in Quarkus, and it can be removed if there are no CDI beans in the application. However, if there are CDI beans, it is recommended to keep this file for compatibility reasons. Additionally, it is recommended to review the Quarkus documentation for the supported CDI features.
