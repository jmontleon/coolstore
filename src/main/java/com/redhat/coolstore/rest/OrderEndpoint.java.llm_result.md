## Reasoning

1. The package name `com.redhat.coolstore.rest` is a common package name for RESTful web services in Java EE. However, Quarkus uses a different package structure and naming convention. It is recommended to move the package to a Quarkus-compatible package name, such as `com.redhat.coolstore.rest.jwt`.

2. The `@RequestScoped` annotation is not necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different dependency injection mechanism. It is recommended to remove this annotation.

3. The `@Consumes` and `@Produces` annotations are not necessary in Quarkus, as it automatically determines the media type based on the request and response. It is recommended to remove these annotations.

4. The `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` and `javax.ws.rs` dependencies are not necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different dependency injection mechanism and does not require explicit media type annotations. It is recommended to remove these dependencies from the `pom.xml` file.

5. The `javax.inject.Inject` annotation is still necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a similar dependency injection mechanism.

6. The `OrderService` class needs to be updated to use the Quarkus dependency injection mechanism.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest.jwt;

import java.util.List;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order;
import com.redhat.coolstore.service.OrderService;

@com.arjuna.blueocean.core.context.ContextName("OrderEndpoint")
public class OrderEndpoint implements Serializable {

    private static final long serialVersionUID = -7227732980791688774L;

    @Inject
    private OrderService os;


    public List<Order> listAll() {
        return os.getOrders();
    }

    public Order getOrder(long orderId) {
        return os.getOrderById(orderId);
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

1. The `OrderService` class needs to be updated to use the Quarkus dependency injection mechanism.
2. The `pom.xml` file needs to be updated to remove the `javax.enterprise.context.RequestScoped` and `javax.ws.rs` dependencies.
3. The `OrderEndpoint` class needs to be updated to use the Quarkus context name annotation.
4. The `@Path` annotation is not necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different routing mechanism. It is recommended to remove this annotation.
5. The `@PathParam` annotation is not necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different routing mechanism. It is recommended to remove this annotation.
6. The `MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON` constant is not necessary in Quarkus, as it automatically determines the media type based on the request and response. It is recommended to remove this constant.
7. The `com.arjuna.blueocean.core.context.ContextName` annotation is used to specify the context name for the Quarkus dependency injection mechanism.
8. The `com.redhat.coolstore.service.OrderService` class needs to be updated to use the Quarkus dependency injection mechanism.
9. The `com.redhat.coolstore.model.Order` class needs to be updated to use the Quarkus dependency injection mechanism.
10. The `javax.inject.Inject` annotation is used to specify the dependency injection mechanism for the `OrderService` class.
11. The `Serializable` interface is not necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different serialization mechanism. It is recommended to remove this interface.
12. The `private static final long serialVersionUID` field is not necessary in Quarkus, as it uses a different serialization mechanism. It is recommended to remove this field.
