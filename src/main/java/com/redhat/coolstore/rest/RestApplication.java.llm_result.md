## Reasoning

1. The `javax.ws.rs.core.Application` class is part of the Java EE API and is not needed in Quarkus as it uses a different approach for configuring the JAX-RS application.
2. In Quarkus, we use a `@ApplicationScoped` bean with a `@Path` annotation to define a REST endpoint.
3. The `@ApplicationPath` annotation is also not needed in Quarkus as the path for the REST endpoint is defined in the `application.properties` file.
4. The `pom.xml` file will need to be updated to remove the `javaee-api` dependency and add any necessary Quarkus dependencies.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import javax.ws.rs.Path;

@Path("/services")
public class RestApplication {

}
```

## Additional Information

1. The `pom.xml` file should be updated to remove the `javaee-api` dependency and add the following Quarkus dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-resteasy-jackson</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
  <artifactId>quarkus-junit5</artifactId>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

2. The `src/test/resources/application.properties` file should be updated to define the path for the REST endpoint:

```
quarkus.resteasy.path=/services
```

3. The `RestApplication` class should be renamed to a more meaningful name, such as `ProductService`.

4. The `ProductService` class should be updated to include the necessary methods for handling REST requests.

5. The `src/main/resources/META-INF/services/javax.ws.rs.core.Application` file should be removed as it is not needed in Quarkus.

6. The `src/main/webapp` directory should be removed as it is not needed in Quarkus.

7. The `src/main/resources/logback-debug.xml` file should be removed and the logging configuration should be defined in the `application.properties` file.

8. The `src/main/resources/logback.xml` file should be removed as it is not needed in Quarkus.

9. The `src/test/resources/logback-test.xml` file should be removed as it is not needed in Quarkus.

10. The `src/test/resources/application.properties` file should be updated to define the path for the REST endpoint:

```
quarkus.resteasy.path=/services
```
