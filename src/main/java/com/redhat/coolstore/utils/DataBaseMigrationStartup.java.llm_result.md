## Reasoning

1. The Java EE specification has been superseded by the Jakarta EE specification, which uses the `jakarta` package namespace instead of the `javax` package namespace. Therefore, we need to update the import statements to use the `jakarta` namespace.
2. The `javax.annotation.PostConstruct` annotation is used to indicate that a method should be called after the object has been constructed and all of its dependencies have been injected. This annotation is part of the Java EE specification, so we need to replace it with the equivalent annotation from the Jakarta EE specification, which is `jakarta.annotation.PostConstruct`.
3. The `javax.ejb.Singleton` annotation is used to indicate that a bean is a singleton, meaning that there is only one instance of the bean in the application. This annotation is part of the Java EE specification, so we need to replace it with the equivalent annotation from the Jakarta EE specification, which is `jakarta.ejb.Singleton`.
4. The `javax.ejb.Startup` annotation is used to indicate that a bean should be started up when the application starts up. This annotation is part of the Java EE specification, so we need to replace it with the equivalent annotation from the Jakarta EE specification, which is `jakarta.ejb.Startup`.
5. The `javax.ejb.TransactionManagement` annotation is used to indicate the type of transaction management used by the bean. This annotation is part of the Java EE specification, so we need to replace it with the equivalent annotation from the Jakarta EE specification, which is `jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagement`.
6. The `javax.ejb.TransactionManagementType` annotation is used to indicate the type of transaction management used by the bean. This annotation is part of the Java EE specification, so we need to replace it with the equivalent annotation from the Jakarta EE specification, which is `jakarta.ejb.TransactionManagementType`.
7. The `javax.inject.Inject` annotation is used to indicate that a dependency should be injected into the bean. This annotation is part of the Java EE specification, so we need to replace it with the equivalent annotation from the Jakarta EE specification, which is `jakarta.inject.Inject`.

            flyway.setDataSource(dataSource);
            flyway.baseline();
            // Start the db.migration
            flyway.migrate();
        } catch (FlywayException e) {
            if(logger !=null)
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE,"FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage(),e);
            else
                System.out.println("FAILED TO INITIALIZE THE DATABASE: " + e.getMessage() + " and injection of logger doesn't work");

        }
    }



}
```

## Additional Information

It's important to note that the updated code may still have compatibility issues with Quarkus, as it may depend on libraries that are not compatible with Quarkus. These issues will need to be addressed in subsequent steps. Additionally, the `Flyway` library used in the code is not a Quarkus extension, so it may need to be replaced with a Quarkus-compatible database migration library.
