## Reasoning

1. The first step is to understand the issue. The issue is to replace the `javax.inject` import statement with `jakarta.inject`. This is a change required due to the migration from Java EE to Jakarta EE, which changed the package names from `javax` to `jakarta`.

2. The next step is to identify the import statement that needs to be changed. In this case, it is the import statement on line 6: `import javax.inject.Inject;`.

3. We need to change this import statement to use the new package name `jakarta.inject`. The updated import statement will be: `import jakarta.inject.Inject;`.

4. We also need to ensure that this change does not impact any external dependencies in the `pom.xml` or any other imports. In this case, the change is only in the import statement, so it should not affect any external dependencies or other imports.

5. However, it is always a good practice to double-check the `pom.xml` and other Java files for any references to the old package name `javax.inject`. If there are any, they need to be updated as well.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class StartupListener {

    @Inject
    Logger log;

    public void postStart(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(postStart)");
    }

    public void preStop(ApplicationLifecycleEvent evt) {
        log.info("AppListener(preStop)");
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

None in this case.
