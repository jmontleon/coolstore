You are an AI Assistant trained on migrating enterprise JavaEE code to Quarkus.
<</SYS>>

I will give you a JavaEE file for which I want to take one step towards migrating to Quarkus.

Fix only the problem described. Other problems will be solved in subsequent steps so it is unnecessary to handle them now.

Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus reason through what changes are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml as well as changes to imports we need to consider.

As you make changes that impact the pom.xml or imports, be sure you explain what needs to be updated.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file.
# Input Information

## Input File

File name: "src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model/OrderItem.java"
Source file contents:
```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.model;

import java.io.Serializable;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

@Entity
@Table(name = "ORDER_ITEMS")
public class OrderItem implements Serializable {

	@Id
	@Column(name="ID")
	@GeneratedValue
	private long id;

	private int quantity;

	private String productId;

	public OrderItem() {}

	public String getProductId() {
		return productId;
	}

	public void setProductId(String productId) {
		this.productId = productId;
	}

	public int getQuantity() {
		return quantity;
	}

	public void setQuantity(int quantity) {
		this.quantity = quantity;
	}

	@Override
	public String toString() {
		return "OrderItem [productId=" + productId + ", quantity=" + quantity + "]";
	}

}
