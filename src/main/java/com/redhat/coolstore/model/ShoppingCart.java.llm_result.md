## Reasoning

1. The first thing to notice is that the class `ShoppingCart` is using the `javax.enterprise.context.Dependent` annotation. This annotation is part of the Java EE specification and is not needed in Quarkus as it uses a different dependency injection framework (Arc). Therefore, we can remove this annotation.

2. The class `ShoppingCart` implements the `Serializable` interface. This is needed for Java EE applications that need to serialize objects and send them over the network or store them in a database. Quarkus applications typically do not need to serialize objects in this way, as they usually use a REST API for communication. Therefore, we can remove the `Serializable` interface.

3. The class `ShoppingCart` has a list of `ShoppingCartItem` objects. We need to make sure that this class is also migrated to Quarkus and is available in the classpath. If it is not, we need to add it as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file.

4. The class `ShoppingCart` has getters and setters for all its fields. This is not necessary in Quarkus, as it uses field injection and does not require getters and setters for dependency injection. However, it is good practice to keep them for other uses.

5. The class `ShoppingCart` has a `toString()` method. This method is not necessary for Quarkus, but it is good practice to keep it for debugging purposes.

public class ShoppingCart {

    private double cartItemTotal;

    private double cartItemPromoSavings;

    private double shippingTotal;

    private double shippingPromoSavings;

    private List<ShoppingCartItem> shoppingCartItemList = new ArrayList<ShoppingCartItem>();

    public ShoppingCart() {
    }

    public List<ShoppingCartItem> getShoppingCartItemList() {
        return shoppingCartItemList;
    }

    public void setShoppingCartItemList(List<ShoppingCartItem> shoppingCartItemList) {
        this.shoppingCartItemList = shoppingCartItemList;
    }

    public void resetShoppingCartItemList() {
        shoppingCartItemList = new ArrayList<ShoppingCartItem>();
    }

    public void addShoppingCartItem(ShoppingCartItem sci) {
        if (sci != null) {
            shoppingCartItemList.add(sci);
        }
    }

    public boolean removeShoppingCartItem(ShoppingCartItem sci) {
        boolean removed = false;
        if (sci != null) {
            removed = shoppingCartItemList.remove(sci);
        }
        return removed;
    }

    public double getCartItemTotal() {
        return cartItemTotal;
    }

    public void setCartItemTotal(double cartItemTotal) {
        this.cartItemTotal = cartItemTotal;
    }

    public double getShippingTotal() {
        return shippingTotal;
    }

    public void setShippingTotal(double shippingTotal) {
        this.shippingTotal = shippingTotal;
    }

    public double getCartTotal() {
        return cartTotal;
    }

    public void setCartTotal(double cartTotal) {
        this.cartTotal = cartTotal;
    }

    public double getCartItemPromoSavings() {
        return cartItemPromoSavings;
    }

    public void setCartItemPromoSavings(double cartItemPromoSavings) {
        this.cartItemPromoSavings = cartItemPromoSavings;
    }

    public double getShippingPromoSavings() {
        return shippingPromoSavings;
    }

    public void setShippingPromoSavings(double shippingPromoSavings) {
        this.shippingPromoSavings = shippingPromoSavings;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "ShoppingCart [cartItemTotal=" + cartItemTotal
                + ", cartItemPromoSavings=" + cartItemPromoSavings
                + ", shippingTotal=" + shippingTotal
                + ", shippingPromoSavings=" + shippingPromoSavings
                + ", cartTotal=" + cartTotal + ", shoppingCartItemList="
                + shoppingCartItemList + "]";
    }
}
```

## Additional Information

If the `ShoppingCartItem` class is not migrated to Quarkus, we need to add it as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file. We can do this by adding the following dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.redhat.coolstore</groupId>
    <artifactId>coolstore-model</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

We also need to make sure that the package structure is correct and that the `ShoppingCartItem` class is in the `com.redhat.coolstore.model` package. If not, we need to move it to this package or adjust the package name in the `ShoppingCart` class accordingly.
