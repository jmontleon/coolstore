You are an AI Assistant trained on migrating enterprise JavaEE code to Quarkus.
<</SYS>>

I will give you a JavaEE file for which I want to take one step towards migrating to Quarkus.

Fix only the problem described. Other problems will be solved in subsequent steps so it is unnecessary to handle them now.

Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus reason through what changes are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml as well as changes to imports we need to consider.

As you make changes that impact the pom.xml or imports, be sure you explain what needs to be updated.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file.
# Input Information

## Input File

File name: "src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/service/ProductService.java"
Source file contents:
```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import javax.ejb.Stateless;
import javax.inject.Inject;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.toProduct;

@Stateless
public class ProductService {

    @Inject
    CatalogService cm;

    public ProductService() {
    }

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return cm.getCatalogItems().stream().map(entity -> toProduct(entity)).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public Product getProductByItemId(String itemId) {
        CatalogItemEntity entity = cm.getCatalogItemById(itemId);
        if (entity == null)
            return null;

        // Return the entity
        return Transformers.toProduct(entity);
    }

}

```
