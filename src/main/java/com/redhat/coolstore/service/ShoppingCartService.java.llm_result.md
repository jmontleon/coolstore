## Reasoning

1. The first thing to notice is that the JavaEE code uses container managed injection through the `@Inject` annotation. Quarkus uses CDI (Context and Dependency Injection) for dependency injection, so this annotation can be reused in Quarkus.

2. The `@Stateful` annotation is used to define a stateful session bean. Quarkus doesn't support EJBs, so we need to remove this annotation. Instead, we can use ArC (Arc is the CDI implementation in Quarkus) to manage the lifecycle of the beans.

3. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ProductService` and a `PromoService` which are injected using `@Inject`. We need to make sure these services are available in Quarkus. If they are not available, we need to create their equivalents in Quarkus.

4. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` which is injected using `@Inject`. We need to make sure this processor is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.

5. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ShoppingCart` object which is instantiated using `new`. In Quarkus, we can use CDI to inject this object instead of instantiating it.

6. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `Logger` which is injected using `@Inject`. We can continue to use this annotation in Quarkus.

7. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `Product` class which is used to get a product by its item id. We need to make sure this class is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.

8. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ShippingServiceRemote` which is looked up using JNDI. Quarkus doesn't support JNDI, so we need to replace this with a service that is available in Quarkus.

9. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `Hashtable` and `InitialContext` which are used for JNDI lookups. These classes are not available in Quarkus, so we need to replace them with something that is available in Quarkus.

## Additional Information

1. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `Product` class which is used to get a product by its item id. We need to make sure this class is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.

2. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ShippingService` which is used to calculate shipping and shipping insurance cost. We need to make sure this service is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.

3. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `calculateShipping` and `calculateShippingInsurance` method which are used to calculate shipping and shipping insurance cost. We need to implement these methods in Quarkus.

4. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ShoppingCart` object which is injected using `@Inject`. We need to make sure this object is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.

5. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ProductService` which is used to get a product by its item id. We need to make sure this service is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.

6. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `PromoService` which is used to apply cart item promotions and shipping promotions. We need to make sure this service is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.

7. The `ShoppingCartService` class uses a `ShoppingCartOrderProcessor` which is used to process the shopping cart. We need to make sure this processor is available in Quarkus. If it is not available, we need to create its equivalent in Quarkus.
