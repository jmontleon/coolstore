## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package is used in Java EE for various EJB related functionalities. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ejb` package instead. This is a package renaming that occurred during the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package is used in Java EE for injection related functionalities. However, Quarkus uses the `jakarta.inject` package instead.

3. **Issue 3, 4, 5, 6:** These issues are related to the `javax.persistence` package which is used in Java EE for JPA (Java Persistence API) related functionalities. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.persistence` package instead.

4. **Issue 7:** In Java EE, the `EntityManager` is typically produced by a CDI producer method and injected using `@PersistenceContext`. However, in Quarkus, the `EntityManager` is automatically injected if the datasource is correctly configured. Therefore, the `@Produces` annotation is not needed and can be removed.

5. **Issue 8:** In Java EE, EJBs are typically defined with a specific scope using annotations like `@Stateless`, `@Stateful`, or `@Singleton`. However, in Quarkus, CDI is used for dependency injection and EJBs are not supported. Therefore, the `@Stateless` annotation can be replaced with a CDI scope like `@ApplicationScoped`.

@ApplicationScoped

  @Inject
  private EntityManager em;

  public void save(Order order) {
    em.persist(order);
  }

  public List<Order> getOrders() {
    CriteriaBuilder cb = em.getCriteriaBuilder();
    CriteriaQuery<Order> criteria = cb.createQuery(Order.class);
    Root<Order> member = criteria.from(Order.class);
    criteria.select(member);
    return em.createQuery(criteria).getResultList();
  }

  public Order getOrderById(long id) {
    return em.find(Order.class, id);
  }
}
