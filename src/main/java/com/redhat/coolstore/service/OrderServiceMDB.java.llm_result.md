## Reasoning

1. The first step in migrating this JavaEE code to Quarkus is to remove the JavaEE dependencies and replace them with Quarkus dependencies. In this case, we need to remove the `javax.ejb` and `javax.jms` dependencies and replace them with Quarkus alternatives. However, Quarkus does not provide an equivalent for the `MessageDriven` annotation and the `MessageListener` interface. These are specific to JavaEE Message Oriented Middleware (MOM) and are not typically used in a Quarkus application. Therefore, we need to find a different approach to handle messages in Quarkus.

2. The `OrderService` and `CatalogService` classes are being injected using the `@Inject` annotation. This is a JSR-330 dependency injection annotation, which is supported by Quarkus. Therefore, we can keep the `@Inject` annotations as is.

3. The `Transformers` class is being used to convert a JSON string to an `Order` object. This is not a JavaEE or Quarkus specific class, so we can keep it as is.

4. The `TextMessage` class is being used to receive messages. In Quarkus, we can use the SmallRye Reactive Messaging API to receive messages. We will replace the `MessageListener` interface with a `MessageReceiver` interface, which is part of the SmallRye Reactive Messaging API.

5. The `JMSException` is being thrown in the catch block. In Quarkus, we can use the SmallRye Reactive Messaging API to handle exceptions in a more elegant way. We will replace the `JMSException` with a `ReactiveMessagingException`.

6. The `CatalogService` class is being used to update inventory items. This is not a JavaEE or Quarkus specific class, so we can keep it as is.
