## Reasoning

1. The first step is to identify the JavaEE dependencies and APIs that are being used in the code and determine if they are compatible with Quarkus.

2. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is a JavaEE annotation for managing the lifecycle of a CDI bean. Quarkus uses its own dependency injection framework, Arc, which is an implementation of Context and Dependency Injection (CDI) for Java. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation is also used in Quarkus, but the package name is different (`javax.enterprise.context` vs `jakarta.enterprise.context`). Therefore, we need to update the import statement for `@ApplicationScoped`.

3. The `Serializable` interface is not required in Quarkus as it uses a different mechanism for serialization. Therefore, we can remove the `Serializable` interface from the `PromoService` class.

4. Quarkus supports a subset of JavaEE APIs, and some of the APIs used in the code may not be supported. For example, the `HashSet` class is part of the `java.util` package, which is fully supported in Quarkus. However, the `Promotion` class needs to be checked if it is compatible with Quarkus.

5. The `Promotion` class is not provided in the code, so we assume it is compatible with Quarkus. However, we need to check if the `Promotion` class is registered as a bean in the `beans.xml` file or as a `@ApplicationScoped` bean in the `PromoService` class.

6. The `promotionSet` variable is initialized in the constructor of the `PromoService` class. In Quarkus, we can use a constructor-based dependency injection mechanism to inject the `promotionSet` variable.

7. The `promotionSet` variable is returned as a copy of the original set. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `promotionSet` variable as a read-only variable.

8. The `promotionSet` variable is set as a copy of the original set. In Quarkus, we can use the `@Inject` annotation to inject the `promotionSet` variable as a mutable variable.

9. The `toString()` method is not required in Quarkus, but it can be kept for debugging purposes.
