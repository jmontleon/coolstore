## Reasoning

1. **Issue 1:** The `javax.ejb` package is for Java EE, and it needs to be replaced with the equivalent Jakarta EE package `jakarta.ejb` for compatibility with Quarkus. This change is necessary because Quarkus is built on top of Jakarta EE, which uses the `jakarta` namespace instead of the `javax` namespace used in Java EE.

2. **Issue 2:** Similar to Issue 1, the `javax.inject` package needs to be replaced with the Jakarta EE package `jakarta.inject`. This change is required because Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE package for dependency injection.

3. **Issue 3:** The `@Stateless` annotation is used in Java EE to define a stateless session bean. In Quarkus, we can use CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) to manage the lifecycle of our beans. Therefore, we can replace the `@Stateless` annotation with a CDI scope annotation, such as `@ApplicationScoped`. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses CDI for dependency injection instead of EJBs.

## Updated File

```java
package com.redhat.coolstore.service;

import com.redhat.coolstore.model.CatalogItemEntity;
import com.redhat.coolstore.model.Product;
import com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers;

import jakarta.ejb.Startup;
import jakarta.inject.Inject;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

import static com.redhat.coolstore.utils.Transformers.toProduct;

@Startup
@ApplicationScoped
public class ProductService {

    @Inject
    CatalogService cm;

    public ProductService() {
    }

    public List<Product> getProducts() {
        return cm.getCatalogItems().stream().map(entity -> toProduct(entity)).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    public Product getProductByItemId(String itemId) {
        CatalogItemEntity entity = cm.getCatalogItemById(itemId);
        if (entity == null)
            return null;

        // Return the entity
        return Transformers.toProduct(entity);
    }

}
```

## Additional Information

We also added the `@Startup` annotation to indicate that this bean should be started eagerly when the application starts. This annotation is not strictly necessary, but it can help ensure that the `CatalogService` is available when the `ProductService` is created.

Note that we did not make any changes to the `pom.xml` file, as there were no external dependencies that needed to be updated. However, if there were any external dependencies that needed to be updated, we would need to update the `pom.xml` file accordingly.
