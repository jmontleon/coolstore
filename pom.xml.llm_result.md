## Reasoning

1. The first step is to identify the JavaEE dependencies that are no longer needed in a Quarkus application. In this case, the following dependencies are not needed:
    * javax:javaee-web-api:7.0
    * javax:javaee-api:7.0
    * org.jboss.spec.javax.jms:jboss-jms-api_2.0_spec:2.0.0.Final
    * org.jboss.spec.javax.rmi:jboss-rmi-api_1.0_spec:1.0.2.Final
2. Quarkus uses a different build system than Maven, so the maven-compiler-plugin and maven-war-plugin are not needed.
3. Quarkus uses a different packaging format than JavaEE, so the packaging format needs to be changed from war to jar.
4. Quarkus uses a different version of Java than JavaEE, so the Java version needs to be changed from 1.8 to 11.
5. Quarkus has its own set of dependencies, so the following dependencies need to be added:
    * io.quarkus:quarkus-resteasy-reactive
    * io.quarkus:quarkus-undertow
    * io.quarkus:quarkus-hibernate-orm
    * io.quarkus:quarkus-jdbc-postgresql
    * io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway
